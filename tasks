Movement (Direction) (Preset Functions for robot movement) (Easy)
Orientation (IMU based) (IF axis <=> initOrientation {alter movement}) (Hard with lots of research ,trial&error)

======================================================================




Situational Reactions (Robot personality) (output to LED Matrix and Movement)
	Movement: Happy, mad, frustrated, etc. (Easy with lots of testing)
	LED Matrix: Face creation (Easy but time consuming)
	Edge detection? (Moderate, Sensor placement is key)


Object avoidance (IF sensor == tooClose{ do this })
	Ultrasonic (Easy)
	Proximity (Easy)


Robot Bluetooth Control
	Control: (Easy/Moderate)
		Direction
		Speed
		Mode switch: 3 Modes
			Autonomous: No interaction from user, reacts to environment.
			Manual with assist: User controlled with sensor input to avoid collision.
			Manual w/no assist: User controlled (RC car mode)
