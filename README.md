# Intro-To-Robotics

Producing an Intelligent Robot / IoT system (40%)
The purpose of this project is to produce an Intelligent robot, an autonomous vehicle, a smart home or any IoT system (we will call it a robot), using at least one Arduino board. Students may borrow ideas from a variety of commercial products (identifying references required). This group project requires 2-3 students to develop a device in a prototype format. Groups should establish a set time for meetings (at least one meeting per week) and record their progress as per the GROUP MEETING PROGRESS TRACKING FORM attached.
1.	Project Requirements: 
•	There must be a MINIMUM of three (3) types of sensors. 
•	There must be no dangerous component included. The maximum power is 18v.
•	Implement at least two intelligent behaviours (obstacle avoidance, object detection or tracking, etc).

2.	Marking Scheme
The Project Draft, Final Submission and Presentation will be assessed according to the following weights: 
Project Draft (5%, Due by Week6, 5pm Friday Apr 3)
•	Robot design document	(5%)
Robot Design (40 %) 
•	Creative concepts	(10%)
•	Well balanced use of components.	(10%)
•	Usability, interface elements, 	(10%)
•	Clear, logical and interesting behaviour	(5%)
•	Information feedback system.	(5%)
Programming (40 %)
•	Appropriate and a variety of use of commands (must be bug/error free)	(15%)
•	Intelligent behaviour developed by the team.	(15%)
•	Design concepts to be well reflected.	(5%)
•	Appropriate comments	(5%)
Synopsis Report (10%, in PDF, DOC or HTML)
All these items are mandatory for the documentation. 0/10 if any are missing.
The report structure should be in the order of the below:
•	Introduction (Objectives, Genre, Target Users). 	(1%)
•	The robot components used.	(1%)
•	The key points of my ideas compared to other similar devices. 	(1%)
•	Identify algorithms or AI developed by your team (in diagram or pseudo codes).	(2%)
•	Flowchart of the robot structure.	(1%)
•	Instruction to play.	(1%)
•	Credit pages: information for each team member.	(1%)
•	Log book showing your teamwork progress.	(1%)
Presentations (5%, during the week 12 Workshops)	(5%)
 

3.	Other Conditions (maximum penalty)
•	Students are responsible for errors, virus infection, lost files, etc. KEEP A BACKUP ALWAYS (100% penalty).
•	References of borrowed materials: source codes, concepts. 	(max 100% penalty)
•	Group number, group members, student numbers and the project title should appear in each submission (10% penalty).
•	Synopsis credit pages will include the role of each team member, students’ photos, contact details and references. 

Important Dates:
(Week6) 5pm, Friday April 3 - submission of your group list and a project draft (group submission):
•	The draft version should include:
-	Group members (student names and numbers), (tentative) Title, Aims, Target users,
-	Your design concepts and components to use.
(Week10) during your workshop – Alpha Build Presentation
•	Zero marks for this component but failure to present your alpha version will incur a 10% penalty. The Lecturer and Instructor will provide you with some comments on your work.
9am, Monday May 18 - submission of the final project (group submission)
Workshops in Week 12 – project presentation
9am, Monday May 25 - Peer Review Due (optional), email to j.jo@griffith.edu.au’
13-14, Nov 2020 – Robotics Challenge (Line Tracing, Obstacle Avoidance, Sumo, Innovative Challenge,…)
WIT2020: https://ausrobotics.org/events/wit2020/

Notes:
-	All Submissions to the Learning@Griffith website.
-	Start your project as soon as possible. The lab will be very busy from around week 9.
-	Each group should have group meetings, at least once a week.
-	This is 10 credit point course so each needs to apply 10 hours a week towards the course.
-	 No extensions at all!  (submit as much as done)
