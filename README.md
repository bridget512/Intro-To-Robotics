# Intro-To-Robotics

<b>Producing an Intelligent Robot / IoT system (40%)</b>
The purpose of this project is to produce an Intelligent robot, an autonomous vehicle, a smart home or any IoT system (we will call it a robot), using at least one Arduino board. 

Students may borrow ideas from a variety of commercial products (identifying references required). This group project requires 2-3 students to develop a device in a prototype format. Groups should establish a set time for meetings (at least one meeting per week) and record their progress as per the GROUP MEETING PROGRESS TRACKING FORM attached.

<b>1.	Project Requirements: </b>

•	There must be a MINIMUM of three (3) types of sensors. 

•	There must be no dangerous component included. The maximum power is 18v.

•	Implement at least two intelligent behaviours (obstacle avoidance, object detection or tracking, etc).


<b>2.	Marking Scheme</b>

The Project Draft, Final Submission and Presentation will be assessed according to the following weights: 

<b>Project Draft (5%, Due by Week6, 5pm Friday Apr 3)</b>

•	Robot design document	(5%)

<b>Robot Design (40 %) </b>

•	Creative concepts	(10%)

•	Well balanced use of components.	(10%)

•	Usability, interface elements, 	(10%)

•	Clear, logical and interesting behaviour	(5%)

•	Information feedback system.	(5%)

<b>Programming (40 %)</b>

•	Appropriate and a variety of use of commands (must be bug/error free)	(15%)

•	Intelligent behaviour developed by the team.	(15%)

•	Design concepts to be well reflected.	(5%)

•	Appropriate comments	(5%)

<b>Synopsis Report (10%, in PDF, DOC or HTML)</b>

All these items are mandatory for the documentation. 0/10 if any are missing.

<b>The report structure should be in the order of the below:</b>

•	Introduction (Objectives, Genre, Target Users). 	(1%)

•	The robot components used.	(1%)

•	The key points of my ideas compared to other similar devices. 	(1%)

•	Identify algorithms or AI developed by your team (in diagram or pseudo codes).	(2%)

•	Flowchart of the robot structure.	(1%)

•	Instruction to play.	(1%)

•	Credit pages: information for each team member.	(1%)

•	Log book showing your teamwork progress.	(1%)

Presentations (5%, during the week 12 Workshops)	(5%)

<b>3.	Other Conditions (maximum penalty)</b>
 
•	Students are responsible for errors, virus infection, lost files, etc. KEEP A BACKUP ALWAYS (100% penalty).

•	References of borrowed materials: source codes, concepts. 	(max 100% penalty)

•	Group number, group members, student numbers and the project title should appear in each submission (10% penalty).

•	Synopsis credit pages will include the role of each team member, students’ photos, contact details and references. 

<b>Important Dates:</b>
 
(Week6) 5pm, Friday April 3 - submission of your group list and a project draft (group submission):

<b>•	The draft version should include:</b>

-	Group members (student names and numbers), (tentative) Title, Aims, Target users,

-	Your design concepts and components to use.

<b>(Week10) during your workshop – Alpha Build Presentation</b>
 
•	Zero marks for this component but failure to present your alpha version will incur a 10% penalty. The Lecturer and Instructor will provide you with some comments on your work.

9am, Monday May 18 - submission of the final project (group submission)

Workshops in Week 12 – project presentation

9am, Monday May 25 - Peer Review Due (optional), email to j.jo@griffith.edu.au’

13-14, Nov 2020 – Robotics Challenge (Line Tracing, Obstacle Avoidance, Sumo, Innovative Challenge,…)
WIT2020: https://ausrobotics.org/events/wit2020/

<b>Notes:</b>
-	All Submissions to the Learning@Griffith website.
-	Start your project as soon as possible. The lab will be very busy from around week 9.
-	Each group should have group meetings, at least once a week.
-	This is 10 credit point course so each needs to apply 10 hours a week towards the course.
-	 No extensions at all!  (submit as much as done)
